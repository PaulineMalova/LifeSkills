Part One consists eight chapters:
<ol>
	<li><b>EFFIA</b>
		<p>Effia is Cobbe's daughter; conceived as a result of her father raping his servant, Maame. Maame leaves her in the hands of Baaba, Cobbe's wife, and she hates and mistreats her while favouring her new-born son, Fiifi. Her father, however, loves her so much and beats Baaba for all the times she beats Effia. It is written that "for every scar on Effia's body, there is a responding one on Baaba's body." Through Baaba's deceitful means, Effia ends up getting married to James Collins instead of Chief Abeeku. Baaba gives her a black stone to carry with her as she leaves. James Collins was in charge of transporting the bought slaves as cargo. Ironically, they live a somewhat happy life apart from the occasional times when James received letters from his wife living abroad. Effia conceives, contrary to Baaba's expectation.The chapter ends with the sad death of Cobbe and Effia finally realizing that Baaba is not her biological mother.</p>

She blackmails Esi into sending her father, who is also a big man, a letter to inform him of her location. In return for the favour, she tells Esi about Maame's former life like how she was previously a slave. It ends badly for Esi, who ends up being captured as a slave by Abronoma's father's people. Her mum gives her a black stone similar to Effia's while they depart. She ends up being sold to the whites as a slave.
