	<h2>THE DRIVE</h2>
</header>	

<p>'There are many ways to kill a rat, including burning the whole house' and 'the end justifies the means' are sayings known to many. They do make perfect sense, but I believe that they need to be complimented with other theories for them to work rather perfectly.</p>
<p>One theory that I strongly believe in is 'The Drive'. What exactly pushes you? What would you like to achieve, and how? What would you do if you failed? These questions among others, I believe, should be on someone's mind as they do anything. One's drive in doing anything is one of the main determinants of how far they would go and how much they would achieve and with what degree of patience. People could be driven by all sorts of things like fame and popularity, wealth and money, passion and interest, security and many others.</p>
<p>I stand to be corrected, but I believe that the best drive of them all is passion. Passion helps one defy all odds, applying the most patience possible. The other kinds of drives are also applicable, only that they could be short-lived. I would thus advocate for embedding them in passion and interest.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship, similar to life, is where you venture into uncertain conditions as opportunities come while hoping to at least benefit in some way(s). Part of the characteristics of a good entrepreneur is passion and interest, so is it for life. When I am passionate about something, I will do all it takes to ensure that I do it best and perfectly. I will apply a great degree of keenness, be concerned with the quality of the output, be careful with whom I associate with, put in all the time I can, apply extensive research, rectify all the errors I make and will hardly give in to despair.</p>
<p>On the contrary, if I am doing something for the sake or for money or all the other things, I will easily give up in case I consistently fail. I will do it as a by-the-way, invite anyone to do it on my behalf, do it haphazardly and use the little knowledge I have without really viewing it necessary to top it up. A little success would lead to me relaxing thus failing in the whole thing altogether.</p>
<p>Well, something quite awkward is the saying that goes, 'Do not do what you love, but instead, love what you do'. I had quite a hard time getting the meaning but it finally sank. Life is quite unpredictable. At times, to survive, you have to do things you have neither ever loved nor dreamed of doing. The system, all the way from the evolution era has always been 'survival for the fittest', meaning that to survive, you have to be somewhat close to perfection. How else would you move closer to perfection if not by developing passion in whatever you have to do?</p> 
<p>I also believe passion for teamwork to be quite a great ingredient for success. They say that alone, you go fastest and together, you go farthest. I would rather be slow but sure and go far, so I would prefer working with a team to working alone. Team work also contributes to keeping one strong even when times are toughest.</p>
<p>In short, passion is not a constant, but a variable. It's not like a talent- God-given, but is like an ability- it can be learnt. If I could come up with a law, I would say that 'passion is directly proportional to the quality of fulfillment in completing tasks provided the passion grows consistently'.</p>
