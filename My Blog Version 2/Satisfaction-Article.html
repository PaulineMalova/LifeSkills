	<p>My first step outside the dorm was quite a tough one, my leg being too heavy to lift and low self-esteem flowing through my veins. I felt like I was defying my values, religion, family, church members, and societal ethics. Wasn't my body supposed to be the temple of the Holy Spirit? I felt like God would punish me right there and then. Anyone who saw me, including the ones in junior classes were like-"Eish! Headzgirl!! Wah! You go kill us today naah!"-the Nigerian accent was famous in school by then. It was getting too much, my esteem was already below -50 and I was already crushing terribly from inside. I couldn't go far from my best friend, I felt like she at least gave me some support in as much as she was the 'Judas' in starting the exclamations for every group that went past us.</p>

	<p>"Announcement everyone! The head girl and head boy will start us off in every activity today, from swimming to dancing to modelling to games and any other thing that will happen today. Have fun." The deputy was on my neck...AGAIN!! Forcing me to wear clothes in which I was uncomfortable was not yet enough for him, it seemed.</p>

	<p>"Oh God please rescue me. It's like people are ganging up against me, your child..." I murmured this prayer as I ran back upstairs with tears filling up my eyes. The devil was not yet done with me. He decided to add some sulphuric acid to my already big and burning fire. God's answer to my prayer seemed to have been no even before I was done praying. I was thrown into the pumped up swimming pool in school with all my clothes on by two ruthless men who were in charge of the whole program. It was obviously done under the orders of the deputy head teacher. I was too shocked, depressed, overwhelmed, shivery and ashamed while contemplating on the fact that I was in water yet I didn't know the first thing about swimming. I, however, had to act fast before I drowned.</p>

	<p>By the time I had come up with a strategic plan on how I would get out of the water, I had already been thrown on the bouncing castle to test it out for the kids by those same men. Did they have a grudge with me or something? For the rest of the day, I was just running away, hiding, being caught, being thrown on stage and forced to dance or do whatever was happening at that moment then running again while complaining bitterly and crying at times. The day finally ended with me gracefully modelling, head hung, between the two enemies-of-my-day holding my hands and pushing me forward with the song 'Sari Sari' playing in the background and everyone cheering. Were they satisfied like the song said with humiliating me in front of the people I led? Guess I was more than just satisfied with the misery on our school Fun Day.</p>

	<p>Many people go through similar experiences while in school. It's never intended to affect a person, but sometimes, it could traumatize the victim and affect their entire life. For instance, one's self-esteem might lower permanently, how the witnesses treat them might change for life, performance in school could go lower due to constant distraction, attitude towards the school and teachers could become negative or even, the victim might resort to spreading the bullying disease so that everyone feels what they felt.</p>

	<p>This is a call to all who are concerned. The world could be a better place if we all just thought of the long term effects of everything we do. It wouldn't hurt to be a little kinder and considerate and also less forceful when involving the people around us in our activities. It would indeed be more satisfactory to leave smiles on people faces and lasting positive impressions in their hearts.</p>
